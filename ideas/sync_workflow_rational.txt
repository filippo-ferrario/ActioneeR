Workflow:
----------

1) find the reference points in a sequence of choice (i.e., the master sequence)
	- the user fill in a spreadsheet with :
		= the annotated reference point in the master sequence
		= the annotated reference point at the beginning of the slave sequences.
		
2) estimate the corresponding reference points in the other sequences (i.e., the slaves sequences)
	- FUN 'estimate_sync': finds automatically correspondences in slaves and output them in a spreadsheet (the master and slave sequences need to be of the same length(?), and with the same interval between images)
3) the user must validate the correspondences and correct them if needed.
	- validation should be done on the spreadsheet output from 'estimate_sync'
	- how to correction should be defined
4) sync all the images in master with thise in slaves by esplicity pairing the file names in a spreadsheet.
	- each sequence should be a column in which the file names of the images are listed and annotated 
	- sequence columns should be next to eachother so that it could be easily found the file name of the images synced.
